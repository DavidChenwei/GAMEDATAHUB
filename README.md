# Project Introduction
This project can assist gamers in gaining a better understanding of their gaming data, such as proficiency with specific weapons and vehicles, highest win rates on particular maps, and the frequency of achieving MVP status in different modes. These insights enable players to enhance their self-awareness, elevate the gaming experience, and visualize their rankings among queried players who have used this project.  
Currently, this project is implemented for the game Battlefield 2042. Therefore, the following examples will be based on this game.   
For instance, you can review your overview data:

The highlighted metallic data indicates that the player holds a prominent position in the ranking for this specific data category. Players also can review other six sections: Maps, Modes, Specialists, Weapons, Gadgets and Vehicles. In these sections, you can sort data based on different headers. For example, in the "maps" section, you can arrange data in ascending or descending order by "wins."

Of course players also can choose win % to review a descending order:

If players wish to access additional data, they can click the three circles located at the end of each item to explore more details. For instance, when players navigate to the "Modes" page and click the three circles, additional data will be displayed on the screen. Clicking the three circles again will hide the additional data.
